# Database

Interactions with the database goes through `sqlx`.
It provides async database operations with connection pooling, migrations support and compile-time check of queries through macros.

## Writing database interactions

All database interactions are done through repositoriy traits. Each repository trait usually manages one type of data, defined in the `mas-data-model` crate.

Defining a new data type and associated repository looks like this:

 - Define new structs in `mas-data-model` crate
 - Define the repository trait in `mas-storage` crate
 - Make that repository trait available via the `RepositoryAccess` trait in `mas-storage` crate
 - Setup the database schema by writing a migration file in `mas-storage-pg` crate
 - Implement the new repository trait in `mas-storage-pg` crate
 - Write tests for the PostgreSQL implementation in `mas-storage-pg` crate

Some of those steps are documented in more details in the `mas-storage` and `mas-storage-pg` crates.

## Compile-time check of queries

To be able to check queries, `sqlx` has to introspect the live database.
Usually it does so by having the database available at compile time, but to avoid that we're using the `offline` feature of `sqlx`, which saves the introspection informatons as a flat file in the repository.

Preparing this flat file is done through `sqlx-cli`, and should be done everytime the database schema or the queries changed.

```sh
# Install the CLI
cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features postgres

cd crates/storage-pg/ # Must be in the mas-storage-pg crate folder
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql:///matrix_auth
cargo sqlx prepare
```

## Migrations

Migration files live in the `migrations` folder in the `mas-core` crate.

```sh
cd crates/storage-pg/ # Again, in the mas-storage-pg crate folder
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql:///matrix_auth
cargo sqlx migrate run # Run pending migrations
cargo sqlx migrate add [description] # Add new migration files
```

Note that migrations are embedded in the final binary and can be run from the service CLI tool.
