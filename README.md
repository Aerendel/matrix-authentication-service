# OAuth 2.0 authentication server for Matrix

This is an attempt to implement an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect authentication server for Matrix, following [MSC2964](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2964).
Don't expect too much here for now, this is very much a work in progress.

## Running

- [Install Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- Clone this repository
- Compile and run the server via `cargo run`
- Go to <http://localhost:8080/>
